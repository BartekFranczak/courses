## 1.
Create a program in the following way:

- In the `main` function declare a static two-dimensional array with $M$ rows and $N$ columns.
- Write a function which will calculate the value of the elements according to the formula (i,j are indices of the element): $B_{ij} = (i+1)*(j+1)$.
- Write a function printing the array.
- Write a function which calculates average of all the elements of the array.
The result should be printed inside the main function.
- Write two functions which returns number of the elements greater than average and less than average.
The result should be printed inside the `main` function.
- Write a function which returns the n-th row of the array.
The result should be passed to the function as an argument.
Use for this purpose a one dimensional vector dynamically allocated in the `main` function.
- Write a function which prints the n-th row obtained by using the function from the previous point.

## 2.
Modify the program by applying dynamic allocation to the array:
```c++
// allocate continuous block of memory for all elements
double *p = (double *) malloc(M*N * sizeof(double));
// allocate memory for the vector storing pointers to the rows
double **tt = (double **) malloc (M * sizeof(double));
// assign proper addresses to the pointers from vector tt
for (int ii = 0; ii < M; ii++)
{
  tt[ii] = p;
  p += NN;                       // shift pointer to the address of the next row
}
                                 // write here a code which uses the array
// free memory
free(tt[0]);                     // free memory used by the elements
free(tt);                        // free memory used by the pointer vector
```
The address of the memory allocated for elements was assigned to the pointer `p` but later the pointer was shifted and it does not point to the block of memory anymore.
The proper address is stored in the stored in the `tt[0]` and it can be used for freeing the allocated memory.
